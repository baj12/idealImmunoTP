## Gene Finder

Do you have a gene or a handful of them you would like to inspect in detail? The Gene Finder does it for you.

Select the genes of interest in the widget in the sidebar on the left. Up to four will be displayed in boxplots/dot plots. 

All of them will be annotated on the MA plot below, and their subset of data regarding normalized counts and DE testing results are merged and shown in a DataTable.

If you have a list of genes, and prefer uploading it instead of typing, you can also do that - scroll down in the page.

Once you are done with this help box, you can close it by clicking on the `Help` text.
