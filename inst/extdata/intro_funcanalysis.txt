#Welcome;Welcome to the tour for the Functional Analysis tab!
#go_cats  + .selectize-control;You can select here one or more of the main Gene Ontology categories - normally BPs deliver result which are helpful in interpreting your data. Three methods are available for each gene subset (up, down, up-and-down regulated, plus two custom uploaded lists). 
#myAnchorBox;Please click on the 'UP&DOWN' tab for all regulated genes...
#button_enrUPDOWN_topgo;... and click on this button to start the overrepresentation analysis based on topGO. This might take a while...
#DT_gse_updown_topgo;... but the results will be displayed in this interactive table, where the enriched GO terms appear on top based on the p_elim column. You can dig back in your data by clicking on one row...
#goterm_heatmap_updown_topgo;... and you'll get a heatmap for the log-normalized values of the genes annotated to that term - some kind of 'signature' for the GO Term in your data.
#vennlists;Especially if you uploaded custom lists (as gene symbols, one per row in a text file), it can be interesting to see how these sets overlap with up- and/or down-regulated genes, either as Venn diagram...
#upsetLists;... or as UpSet plot, which can be helpful when many sets are included. Once you are ready to proceed, click on the 'Done' button to end the tour, and eventually move on to the next tabs.
