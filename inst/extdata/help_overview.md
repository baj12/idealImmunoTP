## Counts Overview

Here you can view and explore your expression data. You can view your data as

- raw counts
- normalized counts
- log2-transformed normalized counts

Powered by the DT package, the data tables are all interactive and searchable.

To get a quick look at how many genes are (robustly) detected, you can change the threshold levels in the criteria below, and if wished, subset the initial dataset (and proceed back to the Data Setup panel, if you want to rerun the DESeq analysis).

You can also display a pairwise scatter plot for all samples and all genes. If you are interested in deeper exploration of your data, please consider [`pcaExplorer`](http://bioconductor.org/packages/pcaExplorer/).

Once you are done with this help box, you can close it by clicking on the `Help` text.
