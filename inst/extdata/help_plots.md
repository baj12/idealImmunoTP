## Summary Plots

Here you can have a bird's view on all your genes with

- MA plots (logFC versus mean expression)
- volcano plots (-log10(pvalue) versus logFC)

You can click on the MA plot, and when the zoomed section appears, click on any gene to obtain a boxplot/dot plot of this feature. Groups will be built according to the factor(s) selected in the `Group/color by` input - this is automatically populated by using the contrast selected when building the results. An infobox for that genes in also shown, with information retrieved from the NCBI website.

For the genes you selected by brushing, you can have a static and a dynamic heatmap (plus the underlying data) available below.

Once you are done with this help box, you can close it by clicking on the `Help` text.
