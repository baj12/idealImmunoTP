## Report Editor

Here is where you can generate, preview, and export your interactive HTML report on the dataset you submitted.

If you are not familiar with R, you can leave the editor unchanged - a template report can do already a good job for you!

But if you prefer to edit any code chunk or add new ones, you are free to do it. The shinyAce-powered text editor supports autocompletion to make this easier.

General options for markdown are found in the collapsible box on the left - these control also the appearance of the code chunks and their output in the report. 

Once you are done with this help box, you can close it by clicking on the `Help` text.
