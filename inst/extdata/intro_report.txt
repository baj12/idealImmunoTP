#report_tabbox;The report can be viewed and customized here. Click on the 'Edit report' tab here...
#acereport_rmd;... and you'll see the underlying details for the template analysis which is included in the 'ideal' package. You can edit that as it fits you best, and then again 'Update report'.
#saveRmd; When you are done with editing the report, you can generate and save the HTML version for it - you can then store and share this.
