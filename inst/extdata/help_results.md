## Extract Results

Here you can generate and quickly inspect the results with respect to the experimental factor of interest.

You can perform

- *classical* contrast comparisons between two groups
- *ANOVA-like* comparisons, if you have three or more levels in your experimental factor

Results are sorted by the ascending values in the adjusted p-value column. You can also sort by logFC if you are interested. Still, please rely on the adjusted p-value to call a gene differentially expressed - the (shrunken) log fold change is rather an indicator of the effect size.

Click on the gene names and/or IDs to reach their page in the NCBI/ENSEMBL databases. Histograms of p-values and log fold changes are displayed for diagnostic purposes.

Once you are done with this help box, you can close it by clicking on the `Help` text.
